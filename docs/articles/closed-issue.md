# So the maintainer closed your issue

Hopefully the maintainer addressed your issue to your satisfaction, with a fix or assistance you needed.
But what if you aren't happy with the result?

Closing an issue does not mean "talk to the hand".
Many projects use issues to manage a team's workflow, and closing issues is a form of house-keeping.
It's entirely possible that an issue was closed prematurely because the maintainer didn't fully comprehend your issue.

If you feel the issue was closed prematurely, you *can* still add comments.
Adding additional context may result in the maintainer re-opening the issue.
