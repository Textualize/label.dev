# duplicate

Typically applied to an issue that is a duplicate of another.

It's not uncommon for multiple issues by different authors to reference the same problem.
Maintainers will prefer to track work on a single issue, and will mark others as a duplicate.
It is good practice by the maintainer to link from the duplicate issues to the original issue.
