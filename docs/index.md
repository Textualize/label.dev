# Welcome to label.dev

This site adds additional context to GitHub Issue labels.

It is intended to be a reference for maintainers of Open Source projects, and is itself an Open Source project which is inviting contributors.

The intention here is to be descriptive regarding the Open Source development process, not *prescriptive*.
In other words it is an attempt to document how developer generally apply these labels, and not attempt to impose some kind of standard.
