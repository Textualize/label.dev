# Welcome to label.dev

This site adds additional context to GitHub Issue labels.

The intention here is to be descriptive regarding the Open Source development process, not *prescriptive*.
In other words it is an attempt to document how maintainers generally apply these labels, and not attempt to impose some kind of standard.


!!! note

    This site is very much a work in progress at this time. Visit the [label.dev repository](https://github.com/Textualize/label.dev) if you would like to contribute content.
